NeuroLink Speak is an innovative wearable system that enables non-verbal individuals to communicate through thought-to-speech conversion. By integrating EEG (electroencephalography) and EMG (electromyography) signals, the system decodes imagined speech and silent articulation into real-time audio output, supporting multilingual translation and enhancing accessibility for people with speech impairments.
Features:
Thought-to-Speech Conversion: Converts EEG signals representing internal speech into audible voice.
Silent Articulation Detection: Uses EMG signals from facial muscles for accurate speech recognition.
Real-Time Communication: Instant conversion of brain and muscle signals to speech.
Multilingual Support: Translates decoded speech into multiple languages.
User-Friendly Interface: Streamlit-based web application with easy navigation.
User Management: Sign-up, login, and profile management.
Secure Data Handling: All user data stored securely with authentication.
Helps people to communicate with a foreigner in real time.
